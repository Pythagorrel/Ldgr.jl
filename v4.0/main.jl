#
# WHAT ONE RUN DOES, IN ORDER
#   1. read exactly one day
#   2. ensure <ROOT>/<year>/<mm>/ exists                        (creating both levels)
#   3. ensure the Daily Journal for that month exists           (creating if absent)
#   4. upsert this day into the journal and write it back       <- only mutation of record
#   5. ensure the "Daily Ledgers mm-yyyy" folder exists
#   6. write the daily ledger for this date, warning first if one already exists
#   7. rebuild the monthly ledger FROM THE JOURNAL (always overwritten)
#   8. flush the audit log
#
# FIXED FROM v2.1.1: `incldue("get_date.jl")` was misspelled, so the file never

    process_day(rec; force, echo, reason, allow_genesis, skip_checks)

One day, end to end. Returns a NamedTuple describing what happened.

REWRITTEN IN v4.0. v3.0 recorded whatever it was given. This version computes
the day's two variances, submits the day to Checks, refuses it outright if
anything impossible is present, and gates the ledger on the previous day being
on record. The v3.0 sequence (folders, journal upsert, daily ledger, monthly
rebuild, audit) is still there and still in that order — steps have been added
around it, not replaced.

ORDER IS DELIBERATE AND LOAD-BEARING:

  1. variances first, because the checks need them
  2. checks second, because a STOP must prevent the journal being touched at all
  3. journal third — the only mutation of record
  4. ledger fourth, and only if the gate opens
  5. held-day retry fifth, which is what makes a filled gap self-heal
  6. monthly rebuild last, so it sees everything the run did

A STOP THROWS. It does not warn and continue. A Level 1 finding describes
something that cannot physically have happened, so there is no version of
recording it that is useful, and letting it through would put a figure in the
journal that every later check would then have to work around.

A LEVEL 2 IS NOT A STOP. An unexplained difference is real and gets recorded,
with its reason, and posts to Cash Over/Short. Refusing it would not make the
cash reappear — it would push the operator to adjust a figure until the day fit,
and a plugged figure is undetectable by construction. The only requirement is
that the reason is not blank.

    _write_daily_ledger!(...) -> status string

Steps 5–6 of the v3.0 pipeline plus the v4.0 gate. Split out because the retry
loop needs exactly the same behaviour for a day it is releasing.

The overwrite policy is unchanged from v3.0 and still asymmetric on purpose:
daily ledgers refuse to overwrite (there is no operator at a terminal to answer
a prompt, so the warning became a policy), monthly ledgers always overwrite
(they are derived, and rewriting them every run is what stops them drifting).
What v4.0 adds is that the refusal now has a name the operator sees — L3-B — and
the confirmation is recorded rather than merely acted on.
