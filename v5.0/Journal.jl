# =============================================================================
# JOURNAL — the Daily Journal file, and the only thing this program treats as
# authoritative.
#
# THE CENTRAL CHANGE FROM v2.1.1. Previously both output files were products of
# one input session: the ledger was built from totals that existed only in RAM
# while csv1() was running, so a ledger's time period was "whatever the user
# happened to type that sitting". That is the direct cause of the missed dates
# and awkwardly grouped periods.
#
# Now a run mutates exactly one piece of persistent state: it upserts one row
# into this file. Both ledgers are pure functions of file contents, recomputed
# on demand. Consequences worth stating plainly:
#   * Re-running the same date REPLACES that date's row rather than appending a
#     duplicate, so a correction is just a re-run.
#   * The monthly ledger cannot drift from the journal, because it is rebuilt
#     from the journal every single run.
#
# This module also supersedes v2.1.1's build_daily_records/write_daily_records_csv.
# Those built a whole month's table in one shot from in-memory vectors; the
# equivalents here (row_of, upsert_day!) work one row at a time against disk.

    empty_journal()

A zero-row DataFrame carrying the correct schema: a `Date` column typed as
`Date`, then one Float64 column per configured category, in KEY_ORDER.

`DataFrame(pairs)` builds columns from `name => vector` pairs; the vectors are
empty here, which is what fixes the element types without adding any rows.

    # CHANGED IN v4.0: JOURNAL_KEYS, not KEY_ORDER. KEY_ORDER is the POSTING
    # categories and is what Ledger.jl walks; JOURNAL_KEYS is that list plus the
    # cash book and the two variance columns. Keeping them distinct is what lets
    # a balance be stored without ever reaching the ledger builder.

    # NEW IN v4.0. Three text columns:

    #            movement, which is what keeps the chain continuous in the file.
    #   Reason, Opening Reason — the typed explanations for a day that does not
    #            balance and for an opening that does not match the last close.
    #            They live with the day permanently; a report is a
    #            notification, not a record.

    row_of(rec)

One DayRecord as a NamedTuple ready to be pushed into the journal.

Replaces v2.1.1's build_daily_records, which produced the whole table at once.
Note the header source: `colname_of(k)` (the key), not `category.label`. This
is the change you asked for — labels are now display-only, so rewording one
can never orphan a historical journal.

    read_journal(path)

Loads the journal if it exists, otherwise hands back an empty one with the

    conform!(df)

Forces a journal read off disk into the current schema.

This is the migration hook. If a new category is added to Config, last month's
journals will not have that column; rather than crashing, the column is added
and backfilled with zeros. Columns present on disk but no longer in Config are
left alone — the program will not delete a client's historical data because a
category was retired.

    # CHANGED IN v4.0. Two things happen here that did not before.
    #
    # 1. The loop walks JOURNAL_KEYS, so the cash book and variance columns are
    #    conformed alongside the posting categories.
    #
    # 2. A BLANK CELL NO LONGER ALWAYS MEANS ZERO. For a posting category it
    #    still does — no taxi fares that day, so nothing was spent. For a cash
    #    BALANCE it does not: blank means the drawer was never counted, and
    #    reading that as zero would invent a balance nobody observed. Blank
    #    balances therefore come back as NOT_COUNTED, which the stop checks pick
    #    up as L1-C.
    #
    #    This also protects the migration case. A journal written by v3.0 has no
    #    balance columns at all. Backfilling them with zeros would assert that
    #    every historical drawer closed empty, and the month-level check would
    #    then read those zeros as real. Backfilling with NOT_COUNTED says the
    #    truthful thing: v3.0 did not record this.

row or `nothing`. This is the whole idempotency guarantee — running the same

double-counted.

Column-sum the whole journal into the four per-group dicts.

This is the inverse of DayInput.group_amounts, and it returns the identical
shape — Dict{Symbol,Float64} per group. That is why the monthly ledger needs no
ledger code of its own: whether the numbers came from one day in memory or
thirty days on disk, build_ledger_rows sees the same four dicts.

`sum(col; init=0.0)` gives 0.0 for an empty journal rather than erroring.

UNCHANGED IN v4.0 AND DELIBERATELY SO: it totals only the four posting arrays,
so the cash book and variance columns cannot leak into the ledger through this
route either. Variance totals are fetched separately by `variance_totals`.

Sum of the two variance columns across a journal.

Kept out of `journal_totals` on purpose. That function returns the four dicts
`build_ledger_rows` consumes, and variances are not a category — they are a
correction applied once, at the end, against a single account. Mixing them in
would have meant giving them a fake category entry, which is exactly the
