# =============================================================================
# DAYINPUT — turns "whatever the user supplied" into exactly one DayRecord.
#
# THE STRUCTURAL CHANGE: v2.1.1's csv1() collected an arbitrary number of days
# in one sitting, which is why it carried Dict{Symbol,Vector{Float64}} — a
# growing vector per category — plus a parallel `dates::Vector{Int}`, plus the
# recursive csv1a() that called itself once per day. All of that machinery
# existed only to hold multiple days in memory at once.
#
# One run now handles exactly ONE day, so the vectors collapse to scalars:
#     Dict{Symbol,Vector{Float64}}  ->  Dict{Symbol,Float64}
# and the recursion, the `day_no = 1 + length(dates)` index bookkeeping, and
# the "another day?" prompt all disappear. Multi-day work is done by running
# the program once per day; the month accumulates in the journal file on disk
# instead of in RAM.
#
# The payoff is in Ledger.jl: a single day's Dict{Symbol,Float64} has exactly
# the same shape as the old `total_cash_eq`/`total_expense`/... dicts, so
# build_ledger_rows can generate a DAILY ledger with no changes whatsoever.

    DayRecord

One day of business. `amounts` is always fully populated — every key in
Config.KEY_ORDER is present, defaulting to 0.0. That invariant is what
implements the "any field left blank autopopulates with zero" rule: blankness
is resolved once, here at the boundary, so no code downstream ever has to
handle a `missing` amount.

Zero (not `missing`/`nothing`) is the right filler because every consumer of
these numbers is arithmetic — sums, subtractions, comparisons. `missing`
poisons all three (`missing + 1 === missing`), and `nothing` errors outright.

# NOT_COUNTED distinguishes "the drawer was counted and was empty" (0.0) from
# "nobody counted it" (NOT_COUNTED). Warnings Guide L1-C.
#
# For every POSTING category, blank genuinely does mean zero — no taxi fares
# today, so nothing was spent — and v3.0's rule of resolving blankness to 0.0 at
# this boundary stays exactly as it was. But a blank CLOSING BALANCE does not
# mean the drawer was empty, and silently reading it as zero would delete a real
# balance and never say so.
#
# WHY NaN RATHER THAN A UNION OR `missing`: the amounts dict has to stay
# Dict{Symbol,Float64} or every downstream consumer changes. NaN is a Float64,
# so the type is untouched; it propagates through arithmetic instead of
# throwing, so a stray one surfaces as a NaN result rather than a crash; and it
# is never equal to anything including itself, so it cannot be mistaken for a
# real figure by an `==` comparison. `missing` would poison sums the same way
# but requires widening the dict's type everywhere (Handover §4 rule 6).

"""
    DayRecord

One day of business.

CHANGED IN v4.0: gained `status`, `reason` and `opening_reason`.
  * `status`  — STATUS_TRADING or STATUS_CLOSED.
  * `reason`  — the typed explanation for a day that does not balance (Warnings
                Guide §4, L2-A). Empty on a clean day. Stored on the record
                rather than logged separately because it belongs to the day
                permanently: an email is a notification, not a record.
  * `opening_reason` — the same for an opening balance that does not match the
                last close (L2-B). Kept apart from `reason` because a day can
                have both differences, and each needs its own explanation.

`amounts` is still fully populated for every key in Config.JOURNAL_KEYS, so no
code downstream handles a missing key. What changed is that the two cash-book
keys may hold NOT_COUNTED.

The shorter constructors still work: the two-argument one from v3.0 defaults to
a trading day with no reasons, and the four-argument one to no opening reason,
so existing call sites are unaffected.

A non-trading day. Every posting category is zero, and the closing balance

counts the drawer on a Sunday, so a typed figure would be fiction (Warnings

    group_amounts(rec)

Split one DayRecord back into the four per-group dicts that the ledger builder

UNCHANGED IN v4.0, AND THAT IS THE POINT. It picks only from the four posting
arrays, so the cash-book and variance columns added in v4.0 can never reach
build_ledger_rows and can never generate a spurious ledger row.

This is the adapter that lets untouched v2.1.1 ledger code consume a single
day. `filter`-style comprehension over each config array pulls just that
group's keys out of the flat amounts dict.

The v2.1.1 prompt flow, trimmed to a single day. Retained verbatim in spirit

FIXED FROM v2.1.1:
  * `cash_eq_in[c1]` indexed an array with the raw String from readline().
    Julia arrays cannot be indexed by String, so this crashed on the first
    real selection. Reverted to parsing the input as an Int first, as the
    original did (`c1 = parse(Int, readline())`), which also makes the bounds
    check below possible.
  * Same fix for `expense[c3]`.
  * `deposit[c1]` / `related_party[c1]` reused an index belonging to an
    unrelated menu; both groups have exactly one entry and no menu, so they
    are referenced as [1] directly.
  * Out-of-range menu selections now re-prompt instead of throwing BoundsError.
